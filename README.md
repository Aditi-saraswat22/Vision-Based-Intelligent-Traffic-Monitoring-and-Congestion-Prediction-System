# Vision-Based-Intelligent-Traffic-Monitoring-and-Congestion-Prediction-System
This project proposes a vision-based intelligent traffic monitoring system that uses deep learning and computer vision to analyze real-time traffic video streams. The system detects vehicles, estimates traffic density, and predicts congestion levels, supporting data-driven decision-making for improved traffic flow management .
